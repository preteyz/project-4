# project-4

Idea:
This app displays a collection of the most popular vacation spots on the browse page. If your favorite location doesn't exist, it can be added directly from the browse page by a loggedin user. Each travel location includes an environment type so people can filter travel locations by what environment they prefer during their vacation (beach, mountains, parks, cities). The search bar allows the user to search by both environment type and location name.

Users can write reviews and leave ratings which will influence which location is displayed first. Users can also favorite locations to be displayed on their profile page.

User Story (as a user I want to):
1. Login/Signup
2. Search bar to filter out locations by name or environment type
3. Able see who favorited each location and number of people to favorited
4. Write reviews and ratings so that other users can see if the location is worth visiting

ERD includes: Users, Travel Location, and Reviews
